The coat loses all the thick underwool in the summer, and only the long hair remains. Hair on the shoulders and upper part of the hind legs is somewhat shorter.Persian cats, known for their facial structure, raise concerns about the ethics of breeding for certain deformities. Since Persian cats have long, dense fur that they cannot effectively keep clean, they need regular grooming to prevent matting. The art world and its patrons have long embraced their love for the Persian cat by immortalizing them in art. A show-style Persian has an extremely long and thick coat, short legs, a wide head with the ears set far apart, large eyes, and an extremely shortened muzzle. The breed was originally established with a short muzzle, but over time, this characteristic has become extremely exaggerated, particularly in North America. Persian cats can have virtually any color or markings.",

        "value": "There are several scales for rating the strength of tornadoes. A tornado is a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground. There is some disagreement over the definition of a funnel cloud and a condensation funnel. Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow funnel, a few hundred meters across, with a small cloud of debris near the ground. Tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not see them. Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors that can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as supercells. This can last from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than 1.6 km across.",
